          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <hr>
          <h3>Poverty vs Health risks</h3>
          <p>We can certainly observe that there is a positive corelation between Poverty and Health risks. 
            As we can see from the graph the states which have a higher percentage of poverty also lack healthcare the highest,
            has the highest smoking population and have higher number of people who are obese.
            States such as New Mexico and Mississippi have the highest poverty and have the highest percentage of population which 
            have the most health risk from smoking to obesity to lack of healthcare. On the other end of the spectrum states
            such as Maryland and Massachusetts have a very low percentage of population in poverty and subsequently very few 
            people lack healthcare, are less obese and smoke less. Hence a positive corelation can be established between 
            poverty and health risks.
          </p>

          <h3>Age vs Health risks</h3>
          <p>When we consider the Median age of the states it looks like, as the population gets older there are high chances
            that they opt for healthcare. The smoking habit tends to be more with older generation as compared to younger 
            adults as we can see that the states which have a higher median age have a high percentage of smokers.
            Finally with respect to obesity, age seems to not have much of an affect as we cannot establish any corelation from 
            the data provided.
          </p>

          <h3>Household Income vs Health risks</h3>
          <p>Interestingly, the household income has a negative corelation with health risk. As observed from the graph
            the states with the highest median income have fewer people who are obese and also smoke less. When it comes to
            healthcare, the corelation with median income is not too significant however it does seem that states with higher
            median income do tend to be able to afford healthcare.
